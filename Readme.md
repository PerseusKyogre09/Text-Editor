# Python Text Editor

Built during my time in school. A simple text editor built using Python's `tkinter` library. The editor supports basic text editing features such as bold, italic, and underline, along with font selection, font size changes, and file handling options like open and save.

## Features

- **Text Formatting**: 
  - Bold
  - Italic
  - Underline
- **Font Selection**: Choose from different fonts like Arial, Courier, Times New Roman, etc.
- **Font Size**: Adjust text size dynamically from a dropdown menu.
- **Undo/Redo**: Basic undo/redo functionality.
